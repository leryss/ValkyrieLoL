Amumu has inspired myths, songs, and folklore told and retold for generations—such that it is impossible to separate truth from fiction.","tacticalInfo":{"style":9,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kMagic"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":3,"crowdControl":3,"mobility":1,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/32.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/32.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/32.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/32.ogg","roles":["tank","mage"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":32000,"isBase":true,"name":"Amumu","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/32/32000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/32/32000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/32/32000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Amumu/Skins/Base/AmumuLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":32001,"isBase":false,"name":"Pharaoh Amumu","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/32/32001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/32/32001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/32/32001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Amumu/Skins/Skin01/AmumuLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":67}],"description":"Boy-king of the southern wastes, Amumu's mummified body still haunts the halls of his ancient tomb.
