Once, he was his empire's most esteemed warrior, leading the nation's armies to countless victories. However, after the empire's fall, Renekton was entombed beneath the sands, and slowly, as the world turned and changed, he succumbed to insanity. Now free once more, he is utterly consumed with finding and killing his brother, Nasus, who he blames, in his madness, for the centuries he spent in darkness.","tacticalInfo":{"style":5,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kPhysical"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":2,"crowdControl":2,"mobility":2,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/58.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/58.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/58.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/58.ogg","roles":["fighter","tank"],"recommendedItemDefaults":["/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/Beginner.json","/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/RenektonARAM.json","/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/RenektonFIRSTBLOOD.json","/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/RenektonKINGPORO.json","/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/RenektonNB.json","/DATA/Characters/Renekton/Recommended/RenektonSR.json"],"skins":[{"id":58000,"isBase":true,"name":"Renekton","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/58/58000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/58/58000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/58/58000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Renekton/Skins/Base/RenektonLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":58001,"isBase":false,"name":"Galactic Renekton","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/58/58001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/58/58001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/58/58001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Renekton/Skins/Skin01/RenektonLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":136}],"description":null},{"id":58002,"isBase":false,"name":"Outback Renekton","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/58/58002.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/58/58002.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/58/58002.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Renekton/Skins/Skin02/RenektonLoadScreen_2.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":99}],"description":"Crikey, what a ripper."},{"id":58003,"isBase":false,"name":"Bloodfury Renekton","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/58/58003.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/58/58003.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/58/58003.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Renekton/Skins/Skin03/RenektonLoadScreen_3.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":126}],"description":"This blood-crazed killing machine scours the battlefield to sate the Bloodstone.
