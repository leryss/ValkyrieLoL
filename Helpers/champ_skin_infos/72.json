Part of the ancient Brackern race, Skarner and his kin are known for their great wisdom and deep connection to the land, as their souls are fused with powerful life crystals which hold the living thoughts and memories of their ancestors.

As the only Brackern awake, he strives to protect his kind from those who seek to harm them.","tacticalInfo":{"style":5,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kMixed"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":1,"durability":3,"crowdControl":3,"mobility":1,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/72.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/72.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/72.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/72.ogg","roles":["fighter","tank"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":72000,"isBase":true,"name":"Skarner","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/72/72000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/72/72000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/72/72000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Skarner/Skins/Base/SkarnerLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":72001,"isBase":false,"name":"Sandscourge Skarner","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/72/72001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/72/72001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/72/72001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Skarner/Skins/Skin01/SkarnerLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":39}],"description":"Travelers seeking their fortune on the open prairie must take special care at night, when massive, carnivorous scorpions are lured by the flickering light of campfires.
