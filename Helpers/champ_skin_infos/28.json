{"id":28,"name":"Evelynn","alias":"Evelynn","title":"Agony's Embrace","shortBio":"Within the dark seams of Runeterra, the demon Evelynn searches for her next victim. She lures in prey with the voluptuous façade of a human female, but once a person succumbs to her charms, Evelynn's true form is unleashed. She then subjects her victim to unspeakable torment, gratifying herself with their pain. To the demon, these liaisons are innocent flings. To the rest of Runeterra, they are ghoulish tales of lust gone awry and horrific reminders of the cost of wanton desire.","tacticalInfo":{"style":8,"difficulty":2,"damageType":"kMagic"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":2,"crowdControl":1,"mobility":2,"utility":2},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/28.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/28.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/28.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/28.ogg","roles":["assassin","mage"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":28000,"isBase":true,"name":"Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Base/evelynnLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":28001,"isBase":false,"name":"Shadow Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Skin01/evelynnLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":28002,"isBase":false,"name":"Masquerade Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28002.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28002.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28002.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Skin02/EvelynnLoadScreen_2.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":28003,"isBase":false,"name":"Tango Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28003.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28003.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28003.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Skin03/EvelynnLoadScreen_3.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":28004,"isBase":false,"name":"Safecracker Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28004.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28004.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28004.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Skin04/EvelynnLoadScreen_4.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":28005,"isBase":false,"name":"Blood Moon Evelynn","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/28/28005.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/28/28005.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/28/28005.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Evelynn/Skins/Skin05/EvelynnLoadScreen_5.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":12}],"description":"A seductive demon summoned on the night of the Blood Moon, Evelynn moves between isolated villages, wooing the residents until they fall deeply in love with her.
