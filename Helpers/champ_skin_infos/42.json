After leaving Bandle City, he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the wondrous machines he found there. He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions, leading an aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known as the Screaming Yipsnakes. Calm under fire, Corki patrols the skies around his adopted home, and has never encountered a problem that a good missile barrage couldn't solve.","tacticalInfo":{"style":5,"difficulty":2,"damageType":"kMixed"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":3,"durability":1,"crowdControl":1,"mobility":2,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/42.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/42.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/42.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/42.ogg","roles":["marksman"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":42000,"isBase":true,"name":"Corki","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/42/42000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/42/42000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/42/42000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Corki/Skins/Base/CorkiLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":42001,"isBase":false,"name":"UFO Corki","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/42/42001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/42/42001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/42/42001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Corki/Skins/Skin01/CorkiLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":105}],"description":"Everyone said this model wouldn't fly, but Corki's never let himself be discouraged by others being reasonable."},{"id":42002,"isBase":false,"name":"Ice Toboggan Corki","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/42/42002.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/42/42002.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/42/42002.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Corki/Skins/Skin02/CorkiLoadScreen_2.jpg","loadScreenVintagePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Corki/Skins/Skin02/CorkiLoadScreen_2_LE.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kLegendary","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":28}],"description":"Having broken the land-speed record in most other vehicular sports, Corki has turned his attention to the ice luge—a momentum-based activity that doesn't require a state-of-the-art flying sled with a forward-mounted machine gun.
