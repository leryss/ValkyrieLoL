To maintain her eternal youth, Elise now prefers to feed upon the naive and the faithless, and there are few who can resist her seductions.","tacticalInfo":{"style":7,"difficulty":3,"damageType":"kMagic"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":2,"crowdControl":2,"mobility":2,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/60.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/60.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/60.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/60.ogg","roles":["mage","fighter"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":60000,"isBase":true,"name":"Elise","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/60/60000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/60/60000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/60/60000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Elise/Skins/Base/EliseLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":60001,"isBase":false,"name":"Death Blossom Elise","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/60/60001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/60/60001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/60/60001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/Elise/Skins/Skin01/EliseLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":62}],"description":"An enchanting beauty she is, lithe in form, and colored like the flowering valleys frozen mid-bloom by winter's chill.
